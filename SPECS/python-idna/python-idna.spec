%description
This is a library to support the Internationalised Domain Names in
Applications (IDNA) protocol as specified in RFC 5891.  This version of the
protocol is often referred to as “IDNA2008” and can produce different results
from the earlier standard from 2003.  The library is also intended to act as a
suitable drop-in replacement for the “encodings.idna” module that comes with
the Python standard library but currently only supports the older 2003
specification.
