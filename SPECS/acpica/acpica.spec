%description
ACPICA tools for the development and debug of ACPI tables
 The ACPI Component Architecture (ACPICA) project provides an OS-independent
 reference implementation of the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
 Specification (ACPI).  ACPICA code contains those portions of ACPI meant to
 be directly integrated into the host OS as a kernel-resident subsystem, and
 a small set of tools to assist in developing and debugging ACPI tables.
 .
 This package contains only the user-space tools needed for ACPI table
 development, not the kernel implementation of ACPI.  The following commands
 are installed:
    -- iasl: compiles ASL (ACPI Source Language) into AML (ACPI Machine
       Language), suitable for inclusion as a DSDT in system firmware.
       It also can disassemble AML, for debugging purposes.
    -- acpibin: performs basic operations on binary AML files (e.g.,
       comparison, data extraction)
    -- acpidump: write out the current contents of ACPI tables
    -- acpiexec: simulate AML execution in order to debug method definitions
    -- acpihelp: display help messages describing ASL keywords and op-codes
    -- acpisrc: manipulate the ACPICA source tree and format source files
       for specific environments
    -- acpixtract: extract binary ACPI tables from acpidump output (see
       also the pmtools package)
