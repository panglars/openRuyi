%description

Package fwd provides a buffered reader and writer. Each has methods that
help improve the encoding/decoding performance of some binary protocols.

The Writer and Reader type provide similar functionality to their
counterparts in bufio, plus a few extra utility methods that simplify
read-ahead and write-ahead. I wrote this package to improve
serialization
performance for github.com/tinylib/msgp
(https://github.com/tinylib/msgp), where it provided about a 2x speedup
over bufio for certain workloads. However, care must be taken to
understand the semantics of the extra methods provided by this package,
as they allow the user to access and manipulate the buffer memory
directly.
