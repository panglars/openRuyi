%description
Libarchive is a programming library that can create and read several
different streaming archive formats, including most popular tar
variants and several cpio formats. It can also write shar archives and
read ISO-9660 CDROM images. The bsdtar program is an implementation of
tar(1) that is built on top of libarchive. It started as a test
harness, but has grown and is now the standard system tar for FreeBSD 5
and 6.

This package contains the bsdtar cmdline utility.
