%description
Structs contains various utilities to work with Go (Golang) structs. It
was initially used by me to convert a struct into a
map[string]interface{}. With time I've added other utilities for
structs.  It's basically a high level package based on primitives from
the reflect package. Feel free to add new functions or improve the
existing code.
