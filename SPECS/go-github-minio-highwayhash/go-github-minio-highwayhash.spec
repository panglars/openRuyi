%description
HighwayHash

HighwayHash (https://github.com/google/highwayhash) is a pseudo-random-
function (PRF) developed by Jyrki Alakuijala, Bill Cox and Jan
Wassenberg (Google research). HighwayHash takes a 256 bit key and
computes 64, 128 or 256 bit hash values of given messages.

It can be used to prevent hash-flooding attacks or authenticate short-
lived messages. Additionally it can be used as a fingerprinting
function. HighwayHash is not a general purpose cryptographic hash
function (such as Blake2b, SHA-3 or SHA-2) and should not be used if
strong collision resistance is required.

This repository contains a native Go version and optimized assembly
implementations for Intel, ARM and ppc64le architectures.
