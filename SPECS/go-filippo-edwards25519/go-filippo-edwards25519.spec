%description
This library implements the edwards25519 elliptic curve, exposing the
necessary APIs to build a wide array of higher-level primitives. Read
the docs at pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/edwards25519

The package tracks the upstream standard library package
crypto/internal/fips140/edwards25519 and extends it with additional
functionality.

The code is originally derived from Adam Langley's internal
implementation in the Go standard library, and includes George
Tankersley's performance improvements (https://golang.org/cl/71950). It
was then further developed by Henry de Valence for use in ristretto255,
and was finally merged back into the Go standard library
(https://golang.org/cl/276272) as of Go 1.17.

Most users don't need this package, and should instead use
crypto/ed25519 for signatures, crypto/ecdh for Diffie-Hellman, or
github.com/gtank/ristretto255 for prime order group logic. However, for
anyone currently using a fork of the internal edwards25519 package or of
github.com/agl/edwards25519, this package should be a safer, faster, and
more powerful alternative.

Since this package is meant to curb proliferation of edwards25519
implementations in the Go ecosystem, it welcomes requests for new APIs
or reviewable performance improvements.
